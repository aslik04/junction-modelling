/**
 * @fileoverview 
 * This file is responsible for animating the entire junction simulation. It manages:
 * - We render the junction, roads, traffic lights, pedestrians, and vehicles.
 * - By handling WebSocket communication with the backend, we have real-time updates.
 * - The canvas is dynamically resized based on user input (e.g., number of lanes), and window size.
 * - The animation loop is continuously ran in order to update the simulation, in real time.
 * - We manage pedestrian and vehicle movement, by retrieving the data from the backend and then animating here.
 * - Simulation speed is dynamically updated in real time, due to a listener for the speed slider.
 *
 * Features:
 * - We draw the road network and updates objects in real time.
 * - We handle signals for main traffic, pedestrian crossings, and right turns.
 * - The pedestrians are spawned after a traffic cycle (where right turn light, turn green -> red).
 * - We update car positions based on server-provided data, which is all calculated in backend.
 * - We sync traffic states, pedestrian lights, and vehicle positions with the backend.
 * - The simulation size dynamically adjust based on window size and based on the number of lanes.
 * - The slider allows real-time control over simulation speed, which instantly speeds everything up.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - junction.js: Used for rendering the road layout.
 * - config.js: Provides configuration settings for the canvas and junction.
 * - trafficLights.js: Handles traffic light rendering.
 * - pedestrianManager.js: Manages pedestrian movement.
 * - images.js: Loads car and pedestrian images.
