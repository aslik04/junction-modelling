Traffic Junction Simulation Server

This FastAPI server simulates a traffic junction, managing real-time traffic light control,
vehicle movement, and client communication. It supports both user-defined and adaptive 
traffic control, allowing for comparison and optimization.

Key Features:
- Traffic Control: Supports adaptive and manual signal timing, real-time updates, and right-turn management.
- Vehicle Management: Dynamically spawns vehicles, tracks movement, and manages queues.
- Simulation Control: Adjustable speed, time tracking, and performance monitoring with fast-mode simulation.
- Client Communication: WebSocket-based live updates, REST API for settings, and CORS support.
- Data Collection: Tracks vehicle counts, wait times, and performance metrics for strategy evaluation.

The server provides a real-time visualization mode for interactive testing and a fast simulation mode 
for quick strategy comparison. Configuration options include lane count, spawn rates, traffic timing, 
and simulation speed. Connects to a frontend on port 8000.

    Runs two separate traffic simulations in sequence to compare user-defined and default traffic control settings.
    This function executes two 5-second simulations at 10x speed, equating to 50 mins of Simulation Time:
    1. First run uses user-defined traffic light settings
    2. Second run uses adaptive/default traffic control algorithm

    The function tracks and compares key metrics for both simulations including:
    - Maximum wait times for vehicles in each direction (N,S,E,W)
    - Average wait times for vehicles in each direction
    - Maximum queue lengths in each direction

    Global variables used:
    - simulationSpeedMultiplier: Controls simulation speed
    - simulationTime: Tracks elapsed simulation time
    - max_wait_time_[n,s,e,w]: Tracks longest wait per direction
    - total_wait_time_[n,s,e,w]: Tracks cumulative wait times
    - wait_count_[n,s,e,w]: Counts number of waiting vehicles
    - max_queue_length_[n,s,e,w]: Tracks longest queues
    - default_traffic_loop_task: Background task for traffic control

    Returns:
        dict: Contains two nested dictionaries 'user' and 'default' with simulation results.
              Each nested dict contains max_wait_times, max_queue_lengths, and avg_wait_times
              for all directions.
    Note:
        Simulation speed is temporarily increased to 10x during runs and restored afterwards.
